//! SIMD-aware polynomial pair for quadratic sumcheck.
//!
//! This module implements a data structure that manages two multilinear polynomials.
//!
//! Evaluations and weights—whose pointwise product is required for the sumcheck protocol.
//!
//! # Mathematical Background
//!
//! In the sumcheck protocol, we prove knowledge of a claimed sum:
//!
//! ```text
//! S = \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} f(x) \cdot w(x)
//! ```
//!
//! where:
//! - `f(x)` is the multilinear polynomial being sumchecked (evaluations).
//! - `w(x)` is the weight polynomial, typically derived from equality constraints.
//!
//! At each round, we compute a univariate polynomial `h(X)` that represents the partial sum
//! over remaining variables. For quadratic sumcheck, `h(X)` is degree-2.

/// A paired representation of evaluation and weight polynomials for quadratic sumcheck.
///
/// This enum stores two multilinear polynomials:
/// - `evals` (the polynomial being sumchecked)
/// - `weights` (the constraint weights),
///
/// in either SIMD-packed or scalar format, depending on the polynomial size.
///
/// # Memory Layout
///
/// In packed mode, evaluations are organized as:
///
/// ```text
/// Logical view:   [f(0,0,...,0), f(0,0,...,1), ..., f(1,1,...,1)]
///                 \---------------- 2^n elements ---------------/
///
/// Packed view:    [Pack_0, Pack_1, ..., Pack_{2^n/W - 1}]
///                 \--2^{n - log_2(W)} packed elements--/
///
/// where W = SIMD_WIDTH and each Pack_i contains W consecutive field elements.
/// ```
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - Packed: Uses SIMD-packed extension field elements for large polynomials.
///   Each packed element contains `F::Packing::WIDTH` consecutive evaluations, enabling
///   parallel arithmetic across SIMD lanes.
///
/// - Small: Uses scalar extension field elements for small polynomials
///   where SIMD overhead would exceed the benefit.
///
/// # Transition Logic
///
/// The representation transitions from `Packed` to `Small` when:
///
/// ```text
/// num_variables <= log_2(SIMD_WIDTH)
/// ```
///
/// This occurs after sufficient rounds of folding reduce the polynomial size below the
/// SIMD efficiency threshold.
